# Week One
- Difference between def and val: The body of def definitions are evaluated each time we use their name (if we never use it, it is never evaluated). By contrast, val definitions are evaluated once, and their result is reused each time their name is used.
- Reason for using def instead of val is to delay the evaluation of a computation to a point in the program where we effectively need it
- Use val for intermediate expressions
